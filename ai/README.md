# Sudoku Solver from an Image Using Neural Networks

## 1. Image Preprocessing
- **Goal**: Detect the Sudoku grid in an image and extract individual cells for digit recognition.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Convert to Grayscale**: Start by converting the image to grayscale to simplify processing.
  2. **Thresholding**: Apply thresholding (adaptive thresholding) to isolate the grid lines and digits.
  3. **Find Contours**: Detect the largest contour in the image, which should correspond to the outer boundary of the Sudoku grid.
  4. **Warp Perspective**: Use a perspective transform to obtain a clean, top-down view of the grid (essentially "flattening" it).
  5. **Divide Grid into Cells**: Split the 9x9 grid into individual cells that will later be processed to recognize digits.

## 2. Digit Recognition
- **Goal**: Recognize and identify digits (1–9) from the extracted cells.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Train a Neural Network**: Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits. You can train the CNN on a dataset like MNIST, which contains labeled images of digits.
  2. **Preprocess Cell Images**: For each cell in the grid, resize the image to match the input shape required by the CNN (e.g., 28x28 pixels).
  3. **Predict the Digit**: Feed each cell image into the CNN to predict the digit. If the cell is empty, it will be predicted as "0" or left blank.
  4. **Construct the Puzzle**: After recognizing all digits, reconstruct the Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 matrix with known digits and placeholders for empty cells.

## 3. Solving the Sudoku Puzzle
- **Goal**: Solve the Sudoku puzzle based on the recognized digits.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Set Up the Puzzle**: Use the digit predictions from the CNN to create a partially filled 9x9 matrix (the Sudoku board).
  2. **Apply a Solving Algorithm**: Use a backtracking algorithm or a constraint satisfaction approach to fill in the blanks and solve the puzzle. This involves trying out numbers in empty cells and ensuring they don’t violate Sudoku rules (i.e., each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain digits 1 through 9 without repetition).
  
## 4. Post-processing and Visualization
- **Goal**: Show the solved puzzle and map the solution back onto the original image.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Map Solution to Image**: Once the puzzle is solved, overlay the solution onto the original image by identifying the positions of the empty cells and placing the solved numbers there.
  2. **Display or Save**: Display the final image or save it, showing the original Sudoku grid with the solved digits filled in.

## Tools and Techniques
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing, thresholding, contour detection, and perspective transformation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch**: For training and running the digit recognition model using a CNN.
- **Backtracking/Constraint Solving**: For solving the Sudoku puzzle using algorithms to fill in the blanks.

## Key Considerations
- **Image Quality**: The performance of the solver depends heavily on the quality of the input image. Clear, well-defined grids and digits will lead to better recognition.
- **Digit Recognition Accuracy**: Training a robust digit recognition model on a good dataset (like MNIST) is crucial for correctly identifying numbers in the Sudoku grid.
- **Solver Efficiency**: The backtracking algorithm is efficient for most Sudoku puzzles, but constraint satisfaction algorithms could provide a more sophisticated approach for complex puzzles.
