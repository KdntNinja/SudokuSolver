# High-Level Overview of an Algorithmic Sudoku Solver

One of the most common methods to solve Sudoku puzzles is to use backtracking, a form of depth-first search. Here’s a high-level overview of how you can implement a Sudoku solver algorithmically:

## 2. Check Validity
- Create a function to check if placing a number in a given cell is valid. This function should check:
  - **The row**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the row.
  - **The column**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the column.
  - **The 3x3 subgrid**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the respective 3x3 box.

## 3. Find Empty Cells
- Create a function to find the next empty cell in the grid. This can be done by iterating through the grid and returning the coordinates of the first empty cell (a cell with the value 0).

## 4. Backtracking Algorithm
- Implement the backtracking algorithm:
  - If there are no empty cells left, the puzzle is solved.
  - Otherwise, find the next empty cell.
  - Try placing numbers (from 1 to 9) in the empty cell and check if placing that number is valid using the validity check function.
  - If valid, recursively call the solving function to attempt to solve the rest of the puzzle.
  - If the recursive call returns `True`, the puzzle is solved.
  - If not, reset the cell (backtrack) and try the next number.
  - If none of the numbers work, return `False` to indicate that the puzzle cannot be solved with the current configuration.

## 5. Output the Solution
- Once solved, print or return the completed Sudoku grid.
